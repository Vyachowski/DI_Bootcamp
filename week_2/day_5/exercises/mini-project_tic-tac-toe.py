# --- TIC TAC TOE GAME --- #

## Instructions:
## 1) The game is played on a grid thatâ€™s 3 squares by 3 squares.
## 2) Players take turns putting their marks (O or X) in empty squares.
## 3) The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
## 4) When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
