# --- FOR NOW ONLY NECESSARY EXERCISE --- #
# SPENT TOO MUCH TIME ON PAGINATION EXERCISE #
# FIRST TASK IS IN ANOTHER FILES â€“ AS DESCRIBED IN INTSTRUCTION #


# --- ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Random Module --- #
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100, then rolls a random number between 1 and 100,
# if itâ€™s the same number, display a success message to the user, else donâ€™t.
import random

def guess_random_number(user_number):
  random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
  
  if user_number == random_number:
    return f'Congratulations! Your guess is right:'
  else:
    return 'Sorry, not even close pal :('

# --- ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: String Module --- #
# Instructions
# Generate random String of length 5
# Note: String must be the combination of the UPPER case and lower case letters only. No numbers and a special symbol.
# Hint: use the string module
import string

letters = string.ascii_uppercase + string.ascii_lowercase
random_string = ''.join([random.choice(letters) for _ in range(5)])

print(random_string) # -> e.g. 'fELch'

# --- ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4 : Current Date --- #
# Instructions:
# 1) Create a function that displays the current date.
# Hint : Use the datetime module.
from datetime import datetime

def display_date():
  current_date = datetime.now().date()
  print(f'Current date is {current_date}')

print(display_date()) # -> Current date is 2023-05-19

# --- Exercise 5 : Amount Of Time Left Until January 1st --- #
# Instructions:
# Create a function that displays the amount of time left from now until January 1st.
# (Example: the 1st of January is in 10 days and 10:34:01 hours).
def display_time_before_new_year():
  now = datetime.now()
  new_year = datetime(now.year + 1, 1, 1)
  time_left = new_year - now
  days = time_left.days
  hours = time_left.seconds // 3600
  minutes = (time_left.seconds % 3600) // 60
  seconds = (time_left.seconds % 3600) % 60
    
  print(f"The 1st of January is in {days} days, {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d} hours.")

display_time_before_new_year() # -> The 1st of January is in 225 days, 07:23:05 hours.

# --- Exercise 6 : Birthday And Minutes --- #
# Instructions:
# Create a function that accepts a birthdate as an argument (in the format of your choice), then displays a message stating how many minutes the user lived in his life.

def calculate_minutes_lived(birthday):
    now = datetime.now()
    birthday = datetime.strptime(birthday, "%d-%m-%Y")
    birthday_formatted = birthday.strftime("%d-%m-%Y")
    time_lived = now - birthday
    minutes_lived = int(time_lived.total_seconds() / 60)
    
    print(f"You've lived {minutes_lived} minutes since {birthday_formatted}")

calculate_minutes_lived("22-03-1989") # -> You've lived 17967882 minutes since 22-03-1989

# --- Exercise 7 : Upcoming Holiday --- #
# Instructions
# Write a function that displays todayâ€™s date.
# The function should also display the amount of time left from now until the next upcoming holiday and print which holiday that is. (Example: the next holiday is in 30 days and 12:03:45 hours).
# Hint: Start by hardcoding the datetime and name of the upcoming holiday.

def nearest_holiday():
    current_date = datetime.now()
    next_holiday = datetime(2023, 6, 12)  # Hardcoded date of the next upcoming holiday
    holiday_name = "Day of Russia"  # Hardcoded name of the holiday
    
    time_left = next_holiday - current_date
    total_seconds = time_left.total_seconds()
    days = time_left.days
    hours = int(total_seconds // 3600 % 24)
    minutes = int(total_seconds // 60 % 60)
    seconds = int(total_seconds % 60)
    
    print(f"Today is: {current_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}")
    print(f"Next holiday is {holiday_name} in {days} days, {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d} hours")

nearest_holiday()
# --- Exercise 8 : How Old Are You On Jupiter? --- #
# Instructions:
# Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:
# Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
# Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
# Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
# Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
# Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
# Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
# Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
# Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years
# So if you are told someone is 1,000,000,000 seconds old, the function should output that they are 31.69 Earth-years old.



# --- Exercise 9 : Faker Module --- #
# Instructions
# Install the faker module, and take a look at the documentation and learn how to properly implement faker in your code.
# Create an empty list called users. Tip: It should be a list of dictionaries.
# Create a function that adds new dictionaries to the users list. Each user has the following keys: name, adress, langage_code. Use faker to populate them with fake data.
