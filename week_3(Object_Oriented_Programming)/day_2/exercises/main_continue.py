# --- üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated --- #

# Instructions:
# 1) Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# 2) In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# 3) Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# 4) Add the following methods:
#    ‚Äì train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True
#    ‚Äì play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). 
#      The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.
#    ‚Äì do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
#      * ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
#      * ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
#      * ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
#      * ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.

# IMPORT

from main import Dog
import random

# Instances
dog = PetDog('Caesar', 5, 20)
eric = PetDog('Eric', 4, 32)

# OUTPUT

print(dog.name)
print(dog.play(eric, chipinkos))

eric.train()
