# --- ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Built-In Functions --- #
# Instructions:
# Python has many built-in functions.
#  â€“ If you feel that you donâ€™t know how to properly implement them take a look at the python documentation online.
# 1) Write a program which prints the results of the following python built-in functions: abs(), int(), input().
# 2) Using the __doc__ dunder method create your own documentation which explains the execution of your code. Take a look at the doc method on google for help.

# CODE

def display_abs_result(num):
  '''
  This function displays the absolute value of the given number. 
  If the number is positive or zero, it prints the number itself. 
  If the number is negative, it prints the negation of the number.
  '''
  print (num if num >= 0 else -num)

def display_int_result(value):
  '''
  This function prints the integer representation of the given value. 
  It discards any decimal places and outputs the integer part of the value.
  '''
  print (int(value))

def display_input_result(value):
  '''
  This function prompts the user for input by displaying the given value as a prompt.
  It then waits for the user to enter a value and press Enter. 
  Once the user input is received, it is printed to the console.
  '''
  print (input(value))

# OUTPUT

print(display_abs_result.__doc__)     # -> Docs...

print(display_int_result.__doc__)     # -> Docs...

# 1) class Currency:
#     def __init__(self, currency, amount):
#       self.currency = currency
#       self.amount = amount
#     # Your code starts HERE
# Using the code above, implement the relevant methods and dunder methods which will output the results below.
# Hint : When adding 2 currencies which donâ€™t share the same label you should raise an error.

# --- Exercise 8 : How Old Are You On Jupiter? --- #
# Instructions:
# Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:
# Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
# Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
# Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
# Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
# Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
# Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
# Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
# Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years
# So if you are told someone is 1,000,000,000 seconds old, the function should output that they are 31.69 Earth-years old.

# --- Exercise 9 : Faker Module --- #
# Instructions:
# 1) Install the faker module, and take a look at the documentation and learn how to properly implement faker in your code.
# 2) Create an empty list called users. Tip: It should be a list of dictionaries.
# 3) Create a function that adds new dictionaries to the users list. Each user has the following keys: name, adress, langage_code. 
# 4) Use faker to populate them with fake data.

from faker import Faker
import pprint

called_users = []
fake = Faker()

def add_user():
  user = {
    'name': fake.name(),
    'address': fake.address(),
    'language_code': fake.language_code()
  }
  called_users.append(user)

add_user()
add_user()
add_user()

print(pprint.pprint(called_users)) # -> [prettified dictionary with fake persons]
